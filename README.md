# Machine Learning Projects

This is a compilation of machine learning projects I have worked on. For these projects, I was applying random models to different problems and datasets. 
The goal was not to select best model for each system or to create an ended machine learning project but rather gain more practical experience and implementation of various ML algorithms .
