# MLProjects
This is a compilation of machine learning projects I have worked on. For these projects I was applying random models to different problems and datasets. 
The goal was not to select best model for each system but rather gain more practical experience and implementation of various ML models . 
Best model selection will be done when serving the models with FastAPI connected to a frontend developed in HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
